Butthurt-PHP-Form
=================

A form to give to users who are butthurt over something they saw online. Allows for many different options and the form submits to a public email.

Users direct annoyed parties to http://www.cnqzu.com/butthurt (a URL shortner is always good) where the angered party will fill out a form indicating where the butthurt took place, how it affected them, etc. Once the angered party hits "submit", the form data are sent in basic plaintext to a public email (instructions for logging on will be below).

The stock email that I included is butthurt.care@gmail.com - anyone can access this email using the password "lolasspain". If the email is abused, I will delete it and change the stock email. 

Any comments or criticsms can be sent to piotr.heft@gmail.com
