Butthurt-PHP-Form
=================

A form to give to users who are butthurt over something they saw online. Allows for many different options and the form submits to a public email.

Users direct annoyed parties to http://www.cnqzu.com/butthurt (a URL shortner is always good) where the angered party will fill out a form indicating where the butthurt took place, how it affected them, etc. Once the angered party hits "submit", the form data are sent in basic plaintext to a public email (instructions for logging on will be below).

I was not able to get the "other (please specify)" radio button to work when the email is sent. If anyone wants to fix that, feel free or shoot me an email telling me how (see below) but until then, that part is commented out.

The stock email that I included is butthurt.care@gmail.com - anyone can access this email using the password "lolasspain". If the email is abused, I will delete it and change the stock email. 

Any comments or criticsms can be sent to piotr.heft@gmail.com
